    "In this study the authors looked at band measurements on the shells of snails. They investigated the placement and interaction between the banding patterns on the shells of 440 individual snails, 271 Cepaea nemoralis and 169 Cepaea hortensis, across 40 populations, distributed throughout the UK and mainland Europe. The data set I chose from this paper is looking at 86 snails from the 440 snails, the authors looked at the colour, banding, and shape of the shells for 86 of the snails used in the study."
